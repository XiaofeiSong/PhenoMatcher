# PhenoMatcher
PhenoMatcher is developed as part of the exome reanalysis pipeline for the paper <i>Post-reporting reanalysis of 
                    exome sequencing data â€“ molecular diagnostic and clinical genomic outcomes</i>, by Liu <i>et al</i>. The code used in this 
                    program is a re-implementation and extension of the algorithm from a previous publication by James <i>et al</i>, <i>A visual 
                    and curatorial approach to clinical variant prioritization and disease gene discovery in genome-wide diagnostics.</i> (2016) 
                    Genome Med. 8:13. The algorithm was used in the publication by Posey and Harel <i>et al</i>, <i>Resolution of disease 
                    phenotypes sesulting from multilocus genomic variation</i> (2017) N Engl J Med 376: 21-31.

                    <br>PhenoMatcher takes human phenotype ontology (HPO) term sets as inputs, and calculates semantic similarity scores 
                    between the input term sets and all disease genes reported in OMIM https://www.omim.org/.
